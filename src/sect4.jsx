                  <p>
                    I was 19, and it was just an experimental index.html. It's
                    not much, but everyone has to start somewhere. Prior to
                    this, I was studying dental hygiene at the University of
                    Cincinnati (UC). This was a big accomplishment in and of
                    itself because the degree is competitive. Many apply but
                    only a select few get in based on their grades &
                    performance. While it was fun learning about biology and
                    anatomy, I realized the job wasn't for me. I needed
                    something more creative. On this day, I decided to try web
                    development and haven't looked back!

                    Wanting to learn more about coding, I embarked on a journey
                    to find a good starting point. I decided to join SheCodes
                    because it seemed like a nice community of women helping
                    each other learn how to code. I took all their courses, and
                    I'm so glad I did. They taught me a lot of skills including
                    bootstrap and react.js, as well as give me a head start in
                    college. Through SheCodes Basic, I made my first real
                    website about my dog Henry.

                    After gaining confidence & skills from SheCodes Basic, I
                    moved on to their second course and worked on a weather
                    website that uses real-time data from an API and displays it
                    on an interface. While doing this, I was searching for an
                    college in Ohio that taught web design & development,
                    preferably online.

                    This is where I was first introduced to Bootstrap. I made a

                    all devices. This was very exciting and I felt so
                    accomplished! I will go on to greatly refine my Bootstrap

                  <p>
                    After enjoying a summer vacation, I was ready to start
                    college again. Since UC didn't have a web development
                    program, I transferred to Stark State College where I would
                    get my associates degree. There I made most of my first
                    portfolio pieces, and learned A LOT about programming and
                    web development. The degree could be taken online or
                    in-person, so I decided I'd do it online due to covid-19 and
                    because I also eventually wanted to move to the Netherlands.

                  <p>
                    Getting my associate's degree was a rewarding experience. I
                    graduated with a 4.0 GPA and was on the president's list
                    every semester. My prior college experience helped me
                    achieve this, as I knew what to expect and how to manage my
                    time. Regardless, ultimately I was there to learn and become
                    the best I can be. I hope to expand my educational journey
                    in the future and try new things. Constantly learning is
                    something that appeals to me about the tech industry-
                    there's always change happening and something new to
                    contribute to.

                    With this certificate, I learned more about AI technology
                    and prompt engineering. It's certainly an intruguing topic
                    for me. Since AI is changing so rapidly, it was hard to find
                    a place to start learning about it. This course helped me
                    realize that, when used correctly, AI can be a great tool
                    for a variety of purposes, and to not be afraid of it.
